            <p>Fundamentally Ghost and AnchorCMS are very similar. Both are writing focused platforms aimed at blogging. Both favor markdown over WYSIWYG editors and both are modern versions of what WordPress once was.</p>
<p>WordPress has become the internets shotgun, a catch all often used for purposes well beyond its original purpose. At its core WordPress is a blogging platform, now its a CMS tack on top of a blogging platform. As a result several potential usurpers have arrived on the scene.</p>
<p>Ghost and Anchor are just two options for blogging platforms. I find Harp.js and its hosted version Harp.io an excellent choice for a static site generator and blog. I currently host this site with Harp.io and host a back up on Github.</p>
<p>For many users, static site generators are intimidating. So if you want something new, you have a more limited set of choices.</p>
<p>Ghost or AnchorCMS</p>
<h4>AnchorCMS.</h4><p>AnchorCMS is an Open Source php powered blogging platform, significantly lighter than WordPress with many of the same features. Posts are written in Markdown or HTML allowing for Art Directed Posts.</p>
<p>This biggest advantage of AnchorCMS and the fact that it is written in PHP is how easy it is to find hosting and get up and running. Virtually any hosting provider supports AnchorCMS and getting it installed merely requires a new database.</p>
<p>AnchorCMS is much further along in development than Ghost, nearing a 1.0 and includes custom fields, feature images and many of the other perks of a CMS that has had more time in the oven.</p>
<p>Templating is simple and uses relatively simple php. The theme structure is concise and easy to organize and there are a growing number of themes to choose from at Anchor Themes (Including mine, Ancora recently updated to Bootstrap 3.0).</p>
<p>The only thing, Anchor is missing (but is currently in development) is a media manager for managing asset files.</p>
<h4>Ghost</h4><p>Ghost is the other contender to unseat WordPress&#39; blogging dominance. Like AnchorCMS, Ghost offers a Markdown editing, simple and streamlined user interface but lacks the potential for Art Directed Posts.</p>
<p>Ghost gained substatial internet fame with its successful Kickstarter Campaign. It was released for download in mid-October to much fanfare. One click installers for sever VPS services including Digital Ocean popped up making it more accessible than was anticipated due to Ghost&#39;s Node.js backend.</p>
<p>Templating is done with Handlebars and is easy to use for anyone who has written a WordPress themes.</p>
<p>Ghost is very early in development and lacks a number of features, including media management, custom fields and even static pages. Many of these items are included in the roadmap.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for AnchorCMS, Ghost has one advantage, while sparse the Ghost user experience has been excellent.</p>
<p>So Pick One</p>
<p>Or don&#39;t but either way its time to move past WordPress. There are a ton of options include some excellent static site generators like Harp.js and I can promise the Blog boilerplate will keep getting better. As soon as I have a little time to knock out some more updates.</p>
