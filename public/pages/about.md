### Hello

I'm Jordan, a terribly inconsistent blogger and freelance web developer and am. I'm a self-styled full-stack developer with experience with Node.js and PHP. I love working with [Sails.js](http://sailsjs.org/), have tons of experience with [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) and love learning new things.

I've spoken at a couple conferences on topics like building processes for teams and the value of goal oriented websites.

I've worked with a variety of APIs including, Stripe, ZenDesk, GitHub, Salesforce, Mandrill, Mailchimp and more.
