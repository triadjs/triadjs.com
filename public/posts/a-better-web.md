##[A Better Web](/posts/a-better-web)

#### I love the internet.  

I love the the ability to learn nearly anything instantly.  I love the tools it provides and the opportunities.  

The proliferation of Open Sourch Software and sites like [Github](http://github.com) create a community driven network of builders and helpers.  

Obviously, not everywhere on the internet is so charitable, but much of Github shows the good people can do for others.

A better web is about more than how websites and online tools look and the services they provide but the way they create community where none existed.  Opportunity at (relatively) low cost of entry.  

I provide for my family with little more than a laptop and a basiclaly rudimentary understanding of the internet.

#### Thanks to the internet.
