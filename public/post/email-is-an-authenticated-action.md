##### You already know this but you probably haven&#8217;t thought about it before. Email is an authenticated action.

This is a central idea in many online experiences; account activation, password resets, Square Cash, and of course the daily missives you foist upon your colleagues.

The potential application of email as an authenticated action is much richer. Square Cash touches on the surface of what can be done. From a functional standpoint Square Cash is fairly simple to replicate using services like [Mandrill](http://mandrill.com) and [Stripe](http://stripe.com). I built [this](https://github.com/jdcauley/StripeCash) proof of concept clone in a few hours.

I worked on [Email Grouper](http://emailgrouper.com/) early on and help build the initial prototype, where the Founder, Trey Miller, coined the term (for us) "Subject Line Commands". Essentially, simple phrases or prefixes in the subject line changed the action in the application when the email was recieved. Functionally the entire UI was in the use of email.

The concept of Email as an authenticated action has spread into propietary third party applications through schemes like Oauth. This has created opportunities for Facebook, Twitter and others to become mediums for the exchange of money or the purchase of goods. If your twitter account, email or phone number is associated with an account elsewhere it becomes very simple to turn a simple message into an elegant transaction.

If we embrace these secondary and external actions in the design and development of applications we have an opportunity to engage with clients, customers or users in new a meaningful ways. Pay a bill with a simple email reply, confirm a ticket purchase with Facebook, bid on Ebay with a tweet.

What else can we do with external actions?
